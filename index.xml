      <description>IntroductionIf the aesthetics are mapped to variables, ggplot2 automatically creates legends wherever applicable. You may want to modify the appearance of legends. In this module, we will learn to modify the legends when shape is mapped to categorical variables. If you have mapped shape/size to a discrete variable which has less than six categories, you can use scale_shape()

      <description>This is the first post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In this series, we will look at the challenges faced when working with data of different types coming from different sources and explore tools available in R to overcome such challenges.
IntroductionThe tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common underlying philosophy and are designed to work together. They share common data representations and API design.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eleventh post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to manipulate date and time using the lubridate package. In this post, we will learn to work with string data in R using stringr. Let us begin by installing and loading stringr and a set of other pacakges we will be using.

DataAs we did in the earlier posts in this series, we will use a case study to explore the various features of the stringr package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the tenth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to manipulate dataframes using the dplyr package. In this post, we will learn to work with date/time data in R using lubridate, an R package that makes it easy to work with dates and time. Let us begin by installing and loading the lubridate pacakge.

Quick OverviewThere are functions to check origin, current date, time, timezone and AM/PM.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the seventh post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous [post], we learnt about using pipes to make our code readable. In this post, we will learn about dplyr.
According to a survey by CrowdFlower, data scientists spend most of their time cleaning and manipulating data rather than mining or modeling them for insights. As such, it becomes important to have tools that make data manipulation faster and easier.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the sixth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to export data/code from R. In this post, we will learn about pipes.
When you are dealing with a sequence of multiple operations, R code can get a bit cramped and not so easy on the eyes. The magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache provides pipes enabling us to write R code that is readable.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post we learnt about geoms and how we can use them to build different plots. In this post, we will focus on the aesthetics i.e. color, shape, size, alpha, line type, line width etc. We can map these to variables or specify values for them. If we want to map the above to variables, we have to specify them within the aes() function.</description>

      <description>This is the ninth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add legend to a plot. In this post, we will learn to add text annotations.
IntroductionThere are occassions when you want to display additional information in a plot. This is usually achieved by adding text either inside the plot or on the margins. For example, you might want to label a line/bar or add formulas to better communicate what is shown in the plot.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the thirteenth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about getting help in R. In this post, we will learn about R packages. Packages are fundamental to R. There are approximately 11000 packages available on CRAN or the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
Packages are available for different topics. You should always look for a package before writing code from scratch.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the twelfth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about factors. In this post, we will learn about the different methods of getting help in R. Often we get stuck while doing some analysis as either we do not know the correct function to use or its syntax. It is important for anyone who is new to R to know the right place to look for help.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about matrices. In this post, we will learn about lists. Lists are very useful as they are heterogeneous i.e. they can contain different data types. If you remember, vectors and matrices are homogeneous i.e. they can contain only one type of data. If you include different data types, they will all be coerced to the same type.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eighth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to index/subset vectors. In this post, we will learn to create matrices. A matrix is a regular array of data elements, arranged in rows and columns. Matrices in R are homogeneous i.e. they can hold a single type of data. Matrix elements are indexed by specifying the row and column index and the elements of a matrix can filled either by row or column.</description>
