# Introduction

This is the sixth post in the series **Data Wrangling with R**. In the previous [post](https://rsquaredacademy.github.io/blog/post/exporting-data-from-r/), we learnt to export data/code from R. In this post, we will learn about pipes.

When you are dealing with a sequence of multiple operations, R code can get a bit cramped and not so
easy on the eyes. The [magrittr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr) package by Stefan Milton Bache 
provides pipes enabling us to write R code that is readable.

- especially useful when you have nested functions
- similar in spirit to javascript's method chaining
- functions taking multiple arguments can be confusing and messy to read
- with magrittr, you program from left to right

R being a functional language, code contains a lot of parentheses. Complex code results in
nested functions making them hard to read and maintain.

If you are using tidyverse packages, magrittr will be automatically loaded. We will look at 3 different types of 
pipes:

- `%>%` : pipe operator - pipe a value forward into an expression or function call
- `%<>%`: compound assignment pipe operator - result assigned to left hand side object instead of returning it
- `%$%` : exposition pipe operator - expose names within left hand side objects to right hand side expressions

- extract data from dataframes, list, matrix etc.: `extract2`, `extract`
- arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply_by`, `divide_by`, `raise_to_power`
- logical operators: `and`, `or`, `equals`

Let us look at a few examples:

```{r install, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
```

```{r import, echo=FALSE}
ecom <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/web.csv')
```

```{r mag1}
head(ecom, 10)
ecom %>% head(10)
```

```{r mag2}
y <- ecom$n_pages
y <- sqrt(y)

y <- ecom %$% n_pages
y %<>% sqrt()
```

```{r mag3}
ecom %>%
  subset(purchase == 'true') %$% 
  cor(n_pages, duration)
```

```{r mag4}
ecom %>%
  subset(purchase == 'true') %>%
  extract('referrer') %>%
  table() %>%
  barplot()
```

```{r mag6}
ecom %$%
  lm(duration ~ n_pages) %>%
  summary()
```

```{r mag7}
email <- 'jovialcann@anymail.com'

toupper(strtrim(strsplit(email, '@')[[1]][1], 6))

email %>%
  strsplit(split = '@') %>%
  extract2(1) %>%
  extract(1) %>%
  strtrim(width = 6) %>%
  toupper()
```

## Summary

We will learn a better way of dealing with `lists` while exploring the [purrr](purrr.tidyverse.org) package. The pipe operators work very well with the dplyr verbs we will explore in the next post.
