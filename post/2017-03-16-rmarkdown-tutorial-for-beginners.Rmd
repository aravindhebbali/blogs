#### What is Markdown?

> Markdown is a text to HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows
you to write using an easy to read, easy to write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or (HTML).

> John Gruber, creator of Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax that makes authoring web contents
easy. It is a software tool that converts plain text formatting to HTML and is written in the **Perl** language.

#### What is R Markdown?

> R Markdown combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks to create dynamic documents. It enables easy creation of dynamic documents, reports and presentations which are fully reproducible.

With R Markdown, we can combine R code, plots and text to create beautiful reports and presentations. The reports can be generated in multiple formats such as

- PDF
- HTML
- MS WORD

The best part about R Markdown is when you have to make some changes to the code or the underlying data and recreate the entire document. You can make the necessary changes and R Markdown will recreate the document with just a single click.

#### Set Up

Install and load the latest version of the `rmarkdown` package.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install packages
install.packages('rmarkdown')
install.packages(('knitr'))

# load the packages
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```

#### RStudio Settings

Go to Tools > Global Options > Sweave
