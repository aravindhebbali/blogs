### Introduction

<hr>

This is the second post in the series **Data Wrangling with R**. In the previous [post](https://rsquaredacademy.github.io/blog/post/getting-started-with-tidyverse/), we introduced tidyverse. In this post, we will learn about tibbles, a modern version of data frames that retain the good aspects (of data frames) while getting rid of the frustrating and annoying parts. tibbles are part of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/). In this post, we will learn how tibbles makes certain parts of the data analysis workflow easier by being different from data frames. Specifically, we will learn

- what are tibbles?
- how are tibbles different from data frames?
- how to create tibbles?
- how to manipulate tibbles?

<br>

### Libraries, Data & Code

<hr>

We will use the following library in this post:

- [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/)

All the code used in this post can be downloaded from [here](https://gist.github.com/rsquaredacademy/9a3814b9b4bb5c271d030b15ce4ecdf1).

```{r imp1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

### Creating tibbles

<hr>

The first step in using tibbles is to learn how to create them. There are several ways of creating tibbles:

- use `tibble()` which is very similar to `data.frame()`
- convert another R object using `as_tibble()`
- use `tribble()` for manually entering the data

Let us start with `tibble()`. Creating tibbles using `tibble()` is similar to creating data frames using `data.frame()`. We 
need to supply the data and name for each column. Keep in mind that all the columns must be of the same length.

```{r tibble1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r tibble2}
tibble(x = letters,
       y = 1:26,
       z = sample(100, 26))
```

<br>

### tibble Features

<hr>

Awesome! You just created a tibble. Before we continue learning the different ways to create tibbles, let us explore the key features of tibbles that differentiates it from data frames. 

A tibble will:

- never changes input's types
- never adjusts variable names
- never prints all rows
- never recycles vector of length greater than 1

<br>

#### Never change input's types

<hr>

A tibble will never change the input's types. To understand this, let us create a data frame and a tibble with the same
underlying data. 

```{r tibble13, collapse=TRUE}
# tibble
(t <- tibble(x = letters, y = 1:26))
str(t)

# data frame
(d <- data.frame(x = letters[1:10], y = 1:10))
str(d)
```

You can observe that column `x` has been converted to `factor` in data frame while tibble does not change
it from `character`. We will learn how to read in data as `character` or `factor` in the next post, where we 
learn how to import data into R.

<br>

#### Never adjusts variable names

<hr>

tibble will never adjust the names of variables. In the below example, we create a tibble and a data frame with the 
same variable name `order value`. In the case of data frame, it is modified to `order.value` where as tibble
retains the original name without modifying it. 

```{r tibble3, collapse=TRUE}
# data frame
names(data.frame(`order value` = 10))

# tibble
names(tibble(`order value` = 10))
```

<br>

#### Never print all rows

<hr>

tibble will never print all the rows or columns unlike a data frame. It will print only 10 rows and only those columns that fit the output area. It will show the total number of rows and columns after printing the data. 

```{r tibble4, collapse=TRUE}
x <- 1:100
y <- letters[1]
tibble(x, y)
```

<br>

#### Never recycle vector of length greater than 1

<hr>

tibble will never recycle any vector of length greater than 1 to avoid any bugs or errors in the data.

```{r tibbles5, eval=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
x <- 1:20
y <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
tibble(x, y)
Error: Column `y` must be length 1 or 20, not 3
```

<br>

### Column Names

<hr>

Names of the columns in tibbles need not be valid R variable names. They can contain unusual characters like a space or a smiley but must be enclosed in ticks. 

```{r tibbles16}
tibble(
  ` ` = 'space',
  `2` = 'integer',
  `:)` = 'smiley'
)
```

<br>

### Creating tibbles II

<hr>

Use `enframe()` to create tibbles from atomic vectors. If the elements of the vectors are named, `enframe()` will
return a two column tibble i.e. one column for the element names and another for the values. In other cases, it will
return a one column tibble.

```{r tibbles11, collapse = TRUE}
# vector of browser names
browser1 <- c('chrome', 'safari', 'firefox', 'edge')

# create tibble from browsers
enframe(browser1)

# named atomic vector
browser2 <- c(chrome = 40, firefox = 20, edge = 30, safari = 10)

# create tibble from browsers
enframe(browser2)
```

<br>

### tribble

<hr>

Another way to create tibbles is using `tribble()`: 

- it is short for transposed tibbles
- it is customized for data entry in code 
- column names start with `~` 
- and values are separated by commas

```{r tibbles13}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  1, TRUE, 'a',
  2, FALSE, 'b'
)
```

<br>

### Creating tibbles III

<hr>

In the previous section, we created tibbles using the `tibble()` function by directly inputting data as arguments. In this section, we will convert the following objects to tibble using the `as_tibble()` function:

- data.frame
- list
- matrix
- table
- tbl_df
- atomic vectors

```{r tibble5, collapse=TRUE}
# data frame
as_tibble(iris)

# lists
l <- list(x = 1:32, y = sample(100, 32), z = replicate(32, letters, simplify = FALSE))
as_tibble(l)


# matrix
m <- matrix(sample(1000, 2600, replace = TRUE), ncol = 26)
colnames(m) <- letters
as_tibble(m)


# table
k <- table(mtcars$cyl)
as_tibble(k)


# tbl_df
k <- tbl_df(iris)
as_tibble(k)
```

We can test if an object is a tibble using the `is_tibble()` function.

```{r tibble10, collapse=TRUE}
is_tibble(mtcars)
is_tibble(as_tibble(mtcars))
```

<br>

### Summary

<hr>

In this post, we learnt:

- to create tibble using:
    - `tibble()`
    - `tribble()`
    - `enframe()`
    - `as_tibble()`
- how `tibble` is different from `data.frame`

### Up Next..

In the next [post](https://rsquaredacademy.github.io/blog/post/a-complete-guide-to-importing-data-into-r/), we will learn to import data from delimited/flat files.
