### Introduction

<hr>

This is the fourth post in the series **Introduction to tidyverse**. In the previous [post](), we learnt how to read data from delimited files and other statistical softwares. In this post we will learn to:

- list sheets in an excel file
- read data from excel sheet
- read specific cells from an excel sheet
- read a single row
- read a single column
- read several rows
- read several columns

<br>

### Libraries, Data & Code

<hr>

We will use the following libraries in this post:

- [readxl](http://readr.tidyverse.org/)

All the data sets used in this post can be found [here](https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets) and code can be downloaded from [here]().

```{r imp1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

### Overview

<hr>

There are two main functions in `readxl`:

- `excel_sheets()` : list all sheets in an excel spreadsheet
- `read_excel()`   : read data from `xls` or `xlsx` files

<br>

### List Sheets

<hr>

Let us start by listing out all the sheets in an excel file.

```{r excel1}
excel_sheets('sample2.xls')
```

<br>

### Read Data

<hr>

There are 3 sheets in the `sample2.xls` file. Let us read data from the first sheet. To do this, we will use `read_excel()` and specify:

- the file name
- the sheet number

```{r excel2}
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 1)
```

<br>

### Read Specific Cells

<hr>

Sometimes you may want to read data from specific cells and not the entire sheet. In such cases, use `range` to specify the cells from which you want to read data. Let us look at an example:

```{r excel3, collapse=TRUE}
# read data from sheet 2
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2)

# read data from cells B3 to C7
# read data from rows 3 to 7 of columns 2 & 3
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = "B3:C8")
```

<br>

Now in the above example, you can see that the column name is acutally the second row of data. This works fine if your
data has column names in the second row. But if that is not the case, you may want to specify column names or let
`readxl` generate column names. In both the cases, use `col_names` argument. Let us look at some more examples:

```{r excel4, collapse=TRUE}
# generate column names
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = "B3:C8", col_names = FALSE)

# specify column names
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = "B3:C8", col_names = c("Strain", "Res_4"))
```

<br>

Another way to read specific cells is through the `anchored()` function. You can specify a particular cell to 
start with and then the number of rows and columns to span or cover. Let us say, you want to read data from 3 
rows and 2 columns starting at the cell `A4`. The first argument is a cell position. The second argument is a 2 length vector which details the number of rows
and columns to cover. The below example shows how to specify the cells:

```{r excel5}
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, col_names = FALSE,
  range = anchored("A4", dim = c(3, 2)))
```


<br>

One more way to read data from specific cells is through `cell_limits()` function. You can specify the row and column of the upper left and lower right of the range of cells. Let us look at an example:

```{r excel7, collapse=TRUE}
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = cell_limits(c(3, 1), c(5, 2)))
```		

<br>

The `cell_limits()` function takes two inputs. The first input is the row and column number of the upper left cell.
The second input is the row and column number of the lower right cell. In the above example, we read all the cell from
the third row of the 1st column to the 5th row of the second column.

<br>

### Read Single Column

<hr>

Use `cell_cols()` and `cell_rows()` to read specific columns and rows.

```{r excel6, collapse=TRUE}
# read second column
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = cell_cols(2))

# read second row
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, range = cell_rows(2))
```

<br>

### Column Types

You can specify the column type using `col_types` argument. It takes the following values:

- `skip`
- `guess`
- `logical`
- `numeric`
- `date`
- `text`
- `list`

If all the columns are the same type, you can mention the column type once and it will be recycled.

```{r excel8, collapse=TRUE}
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, col_types = c("numeric", "text", "numeric"))
```

<br>

### Others

<hr>

You can specify the number of rows to skip before reading data using `skip` argument and the maximum
number of rows to read using the `n_max` argument. Below are a couple of examples:

```{r excel9, collapse=TRUE}
# skip first 3 rows
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, skip = 3, col_names = FALSE)

# read 10 rows
read_excel('sample2.xls', sheet = 2, n_max = 10)
```

<br>

### Summary

<hr>

In this post, we learnt to:

- list sheets in a file using `excel_sheets()`
- read data from excel sheets using `read_excel()`
- read specific cells using `range` argument
- specify range of cells using:
    - `anchored()`
    - `cell_limits()
- read specific columns using `cell_cols()`
- read specific rows using `cell_rows()`

### Up Next..

<hr>

In the next [post](), we will learn to read data from `JSON` and `XML` files.
