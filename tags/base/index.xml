      <description>IntroductionThis is the tenth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add text annotations to plots. In this post, we will learn how to combine multiple plots. Often, it is useful to have multiple plots in the same frame as it allows us to get a comprehensive view of a particular variable or compare among different variables. The Graphics package offers two methods to combine multiple plots.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add legend to a plot. In this post, we will learn to add text annotations. There are occassions when you want to display additional information in a plot. This is usually achieved by adding text either inside the plot or on the margins. For example, you might want to label a line/bar or add formulas to better communicate what is shown in the plot.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eighth post in the series Data Visualisation With R. In the previous post, we learnt to build histograms. In this post, we will learn how to:
position the legend within the plotmodify the layout using ncol and horiz argumentsadd title using the title. set of argumentsmodify the appearance and position of the legend boxmodify the appearance of the text in the legend boxLegends are used to convey information about the data being represented by a plot.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the seventh post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt about box and whisker plots. In this post, we will learn to:
create a bare bones histogramspecify the number of bins/intervalsrepresent frequency density on the Y axisadd colors to the bars and the borderadd labels to the barsA histogram is a plot that can be used to examine the shape and spread of continuous data.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the sixth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to build bar plots. In this post, we will learn to
create univariate/multivariate box plotsinterpret box plotscreate horizontal box plotsdetect outliersmodify box coloruse formula to compare distributions of different variablesuse notches to compare medians

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to build scatter plots. In this post, we will build line graphs. To be more specific we will learn to
create line plotsadd color to linesmodify line type/stylemodify line widthadd points to the linesmodify axis rangeadd additional lines to the plot</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the third post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learned how to add title, subtitle and axis labels. We also learned how to modify the range of the axis. In this post, we will learn how to create scatter plots. If you remember, we had created a scatter plot in this post, using the plot() function. We will continue with the same plot and learn how to enhance a scatter plot by</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the second post of the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we explored the plot() function and observed the different types of plots it generated. In this post, we will learn how to add:
TitleSubtitleAxis Labelsto a plot and how to modify:
Axis rangeIn the previous post, we created plots which did not have any title or labels.</description>
