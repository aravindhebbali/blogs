      <description>This is the tenth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add text annotations to plots. In this post, we will learn how to combine multiple plots.
IntroductionOften, it is useful to have multiple plots in the same frame as it allows us to get a comprehensive view of a particular variable or compare among different variables. Listed below are two methods to combine plots:</description>

      <description>This is the ninth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add legend to a plot. In this post, we will learn to add text annotations.
IntroductionThere are occassions when you want to display additional information in a plot. This is usually achieved by adding text either inside the plot or on the margins. For example, you might want to label a line/bar or add formulas to better communicate what is shown in the plot.</description>

      <description>This is the eighth post in the series Data Visualisation With R. In the previous post, we learnt to build histograms. In this post, we will learn how to add a legend to a plot in R.
IntroductionLegends are used to convey information about the data being represented by a plot. To understand the importance of legends, let us look at the two plots below. In the first plot, would you be able to understand what the lines represent in the absence of a legend?</description>

      <description>This is the seventh post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt about box and whisker plots. In this post, we will learn about histograms.
IntroductionA histogram is a plot that can be used to examine the shape and spread of continuous data. It looks very similar to a bar graph and can be used to detect outliers and skewness in data.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the sixth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to build bar plots. In this post, we will learn to
create univariate/multivariate box plotsinterpret box plotscreate horizontal box plotsdetect outliersmodify box coloruse formula to compare distributions of different variablesuse notches to compare medians
Box PlotThe box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to build scatter plots. In this post, we will build line graphs. To be more specific we will learn to
create line plotsadd color to linesmodify line type/stylemodify line widthadd points to the linesmodify axis rangeadd additional lines to the plot</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the third post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learned how to add title, subtitle and axis labels. We also learned how to modify the range of the axis. In this post, we will learn how to create scatter plots. If you remember, we had created a scatter plot in this post, using the plot() function. We will continue with the same plot and learn how to enhance a scatter plot by</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the second post of the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we explored the plot() function and observed the different types of plots it generated. In this post, we will learn how to add:
TitleSubtitleAxis Labelsto a plot and how to modify:
Axis rangeIn the previous post, we created plots which did not have any title or labels.</description>
