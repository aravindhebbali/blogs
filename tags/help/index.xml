      <description>IntroductionThis is the thirteenth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about getting help in R. In this post, we will learn about R packages. Packages are fundamental to R. There are approximately 11000 packages available on CRAN or the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
Packages are available for different topics. You should always look for a package before writing code from scratch. In case you have written your own codes for a new analysis or topic, do share it with the R community by converting the code into a package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the twelfth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about factors. In this post, we will learn about the different methods of getting help in R. Often we get stuck while doing some analysis as either we do not know the correct function to use or its syntax. It is important for anyone who is new to R to know the right place to look for help.</description>
