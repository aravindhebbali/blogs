      <description>IntroductionThis is the thirteenth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about getting help in R. In this post, we will learn about R packages. Packages are fundamental to R. There are approximately 11000 packages available on CRAN or the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
Packages are available for different topics. You should always look for a package before writing code from scratch. In case you have written your own codes for a new analysis or topic, do share it with the R community by converting the code into a package.</description>
