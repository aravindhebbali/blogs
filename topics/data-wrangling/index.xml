      <description>This is the 10th post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt helper functions in dplyr package. In this post, we will learn about purrr, an R package that enhances Râ€™s functional programming toolkit. Let us begin by installing and loading purrr and a set of other pacakges we will be using.
As we did in the earlier posts in this series, we will use a case study to explore the various features of the stringr package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt how to combine tables using the *_join() family of functions in dplyr.
In this post, we will explore a set of helper functions in order to:
extract unique rowsrename columnssample dataextract columnsslice rowsarrange rowscompare tablesextract/mutate data using predicate functionscount observations for different levels of a variable</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eighth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In a previous post, we learnt about dplyr verbs and used them to compute average order value for an e-commerce website data. In this post, we will learn to combine tables using different join functions provided in dplyr. Let us assume we have 2 tables y and y. Below are the different types of join functions provided in dplyr.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the second post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we introduced tidyverse. In this post, we will learn about tibbles, a modern version of data frames that retain the good aspects (of data frames) while getting rid of the frustrating and annoying parts. tibbles are part of the tidyverse. In this post, we will learn how tibbles makes certain parts of the data analysis workflow easier by being different from data frames.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In this series, we will look at the challenges faced when working with data of different types coming from different sources and explore tools available in R to overcome such challenges.
IntroductionThe tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common underlying philosophy and are designed to work together. They share common data representations and API design.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eleventh post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to manipulate date and time using the lubridate package. In this post, we will learn to work with string data in R using stringr. Let us begin by installing and loading stringr and a set of other pacakges we will be using.

DataAs we did in the earlier posts in this series, we will use a case study to explore the various features of the stringr package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the tenth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to manipulate dataframes using the dplyr package. In this post, we will learn to work with date/time data in R using lubridate, an R package that makes it easy to work with dates and time. Let us begin by installing and loading the lubridate pacakge.

Quick OverviewThere are functions to check origin, current date, time, timezone and AM/PM.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the seventh post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous [post], we learnt about using pipes to make our code readable. In this post, we will learn about dplyr.
According to a survey by CrowdFlower, data scientists spend most of their time cleaning and manipulating data rather than mining or modeling them for insights. As such, it becomes important to have tools that make data manipulation faster and easier.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the sixth post in the series Data Wrangling with R. In the previous post, we learnt to export data/code from R. In this post, we will learn about pipes.
When you are dealing with a sequence of multiple operations, R code can get a bit cramped and not so easy on the eyes. The magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache provides pipes enabling us to write R code that is readable.</description>
